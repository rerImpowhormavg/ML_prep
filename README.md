# Machine Learning Interview Prep!
## Goal: To prepare those looking to transition into a MLE role.

In the next few weeks I will be generating the following content:
  
    -Phone screening ML interview questions (algorithms, validation methods, stats)
    -Phone screening DL/AI interview questions
    -CS whiteboarding fundamental examples (Jupyter notebooks)
    -ML system design problems + solutions (Jupyter notebooks)
    
ENJOY!
